# Welcome to the bagel

This is the everything bagel.

A website consisting of various sections pertaining to multiple functionalities. Inspired by the movie Everything Everywhere All at Once by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.

The whole idea is a combination of various online datasets (all mostly through open source APIs) into a meaningful format - making a fun and mostly silly yet slightly productive experience.

# Main Components

## 1. Art
There is an Art section available which consists of the ability to query through and fetch art pieces from two major museums of the world.

The idea being that both the museums combined host over 700k art pieces and any normal human being couldn't sift through them with normal amounts of patience.

You are able to view one art piece in random and view all relevant information pertaining to it.

Works for the Metrpolitan Museum of Modern Art and the Chicago Art Museum.

## 2. World Information
Allows you to fetch various information about the world in realtime. Mainly:

### 2.1. Search any IP/e-mail/DNS
Allows you to geolocate and fetch all registrant information about any IP address or e-mail or DNS.

### 2.2. World Registered Domains
You can query and search for any registered domains on the www and the corresponding keywords for them, too.

### 2.3. World Forex Rates
Fetches the most recent forex rates (using EUR as the base currency) - updates daily.

### 2.4. Indian Postal Codes
Allows you to search up any Indian Pin (ZIP) code and get corresponding information about everything pertaining to it.


## 3. Every Day is Special
If any day feels very dull - or feels like it will never end - this is just the place! Shows all the notable people who died on this day, all major events that happened and all the notable people who were born on this day! You can customize the day and search for a particular date too if you wish to.

## 4. Analytics and Data
Has subsections pertaining to analysing data and giving estimates based on said data.

### 4.1 Name-Based Estimations
Queries a big dataset in the backend consisting of scraped data of several websites/census - the agify api will try to guess the age/gender/nationality corresponding to the name.

### 4.2 Unified Metadata
Allows you to fetch complete metadata / text crawling / embedded images for any website URL without needing to visit the website yourself.

## 5. Religious Stuff
Allows you to view a random verse from three holy books: Bhagavad Gita, Bible, Quran. You can also choose to fetch one particular verse from any one of the three major holy books.

## 6. Silly Things
The section that ties the whole thing together! Allows you to fetch a random cat fact or a dog fact on demand! You can also view a random cat image/gif or a dog image/gif when needed. Also, has a fox and duck section!
