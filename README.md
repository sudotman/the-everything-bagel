# Welcome to the bagel

This is the everything bagel.

A website consisting of various sections pertaining to multiple functionalities. Inspired by the movie Everything Everywhere All at Once by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert.

The whole idea is a combination of various online datasets (all mostly through open source APIs) into a meaningful format - making a fun and mostly silly yet slightly productive experience.

# Main Components

## 1. Art
There is an Art section available which consists of the ability to query through and fetch art pieces from two major museums of the world.

The idea being that both the museums combined host over 700k art pieces and any normal human being couldn't sift through them with normal amounts of patience.

You are able to view one art piece in random and view all relevant information pertaining to it.

Works for the Metrpolitan Museum of Modern Art and the Chicago Art Museum.
